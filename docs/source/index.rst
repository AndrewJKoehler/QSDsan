What is QSDsan?
----------------------------

**QSDsan** is a package for the quantitative sustainable design of sanitation and resource recovery systems leveraging the structure and modules developed in BioSTEAM [1]_. As an open-source and impact-driven platform, QSDsan aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment and under uncertainty). 

All systems developed with QSDsan will be included in another repository in the future.


Getting Started
---------------
First install the package at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_. If you use pip, simply ``pip install qsdsan``.


Follow the tutorial to get started!

How does QSDsan work?
---------------------

QSDsan follows the structure of `BioSTEAM <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_, a fast and flexible package for the design, simulation, and techno-economic analysis of biorefineries under uncertainty, but QSDsan is enhanced with features geared toward quantitative sustainable design of sanitation systems.

The above Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram of the package shows the relationship between QSDsan and its dependencies `biosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_, `thermosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam>`_, and `chemicals <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_.

In particular, QSDsan introduces:
 - ``Component``, a subclass of ``Chemical`` in thermosteam, instance of this class does not necessarily corresponds to a specific chemical, but represents commonly used/modeled component such as biodegradable colloidal substrate.

 - ``WasteStream``, a sublcass of ``Stream`` in thermosteam, instance of this class has additional composite properties such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) that are widely used in sanitation systems.

 - ``Process``, a new class that describes a certain biological, chemical, or physical process in a unit operation, it has some similarities with the ``reaction`` class in thermosteam, but has unique features and utilities.
