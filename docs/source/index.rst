What is ``QSDsan``?
-------------------

``QSDsan`` is a package for the quantitative sustainable design of sanitation and resource recovery systems leveraging the structure and modules developed in ``BioSTEAM`` [1]_. As an open-source and impact-driven platform, QSDsan aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment and under uncertainty). 

All systems developed with ``QSDsan`` will be included in another repository in the future.


Getting Started
---------------
First install the package at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_. If you use pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install qsdsan


Follow the tutorial to get started!

How does ``QSDsan`` work?

   Simplified unified modeling language (UML) diagram of ``QSDsan``

``QSDsan`` follows the structure of `BioSTEAM <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_, a fast and flexible package for the design, simulation, and techno-economic analysis of biorefineries under uncertainty, but ``QSDsan`` is enhanced with features geared toward quantitative sustainable design of sanitation systems.

The above Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram of the package shows the relationship between ``QSDsan`` and its dependencies `biosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_ and `thermosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam>`_.

In particular, ``QSDsan`` introduces:

- :class:`~.Component`, a subclass of :class:`thermosteam.Chemical`, instance of this class does not necessarily corresponds to a specific chemical, but represents commonly used/modeled component such as biodegradable colloidal substrate.
- :class:`~.WasteStream`, a sublcass of :class:`thermosteam.Stream`, instance of this class has additional composite properties such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) that are widely used in sanitation systems.
- :class:`Process` (*under development*), a new class that describes a certain biological, chemical, or physical process in a unit operation, it has some similarities with :class:`thermosteam.reaction`, but has unique features and utilities.
