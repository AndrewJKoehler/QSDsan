What is Sanitation Explorer?
----------------------------
**Sanitation Explorer** is a package for the sustainable design of non-sewered sanitation technologies that are affordable and appropriate in low-income, resource-limited settings leveraging the structure and modules developed in BioSTEAM [1]_. As an open-source and impact-driven platform, Sanitation Explorer aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment under uncertainty).

All systems developed with the Sanitation Explorer package will be included in another repository in the future.


Getting Started
---------------
Want to try out Sanitation Explorer? First install the package at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_. If you use pip, simply ``pip install sanitation`` *Note: NOT READY YET*.


Follow the tutorial to get started!

How does Sanitation Explorer work?
----------------------------------
.. figure:: ./images/sanitation_UML.png

Sanitation Explorer follows the structure of `BioSTEAM <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_, a fast and flexible package for the design, simulation, and techno-economic analysis of biorefineries under uncertainty, but Sanitation Explorer is enhanced with features geared toward quantitative sustainable design of sanitation systems.

The above Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram of the package shows the relationship between Sanitation Explorer and its dependencies `biosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_, `thermosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam>`_, and `chemicals <https://github.com/CalebBell/chemicals>`_.

In particular, Sanitation Explorer introduces:
 - ``Component``, a subclass of ``Chemical`` in thermosteam, instance of this class does not necessarily corresponds to a specific chemical, but represents commonly used/modeled component such as biodegradable colloidal substrate.

 - ``WasteStream``, a sublcass of ``Stream`` in thermosteam, instance of this class has additional composite properties such as chemical oxygen demand (COD) that are widely used in sanitation systems.

 - ``Process``, a new class that describes a certain biological, chemical, or physical process in a unit operation, it has some similarities with the ``reaction`` class in thermosteam, but has unique features and utilities.
