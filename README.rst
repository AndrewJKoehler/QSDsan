What is Sanitation Explorer?
----------------------------

**Sanitation Explorer** is a package for the sustainable design of non-sewered sanitation technologies that are affordable and appropriate in low-income, resource-limited settings leveraging the structure and modules developed in BioSTEAM [1]_. As an open-source and impact-driven platform, **Sanitation Explorer** aims to identify configuration combinations, systematically probe interdependencies across technologies, and identify key sensitivities to contextual assumptions through the use of quantitative sustainable design methods (life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis under uncertainty).
